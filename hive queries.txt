Top complaints: The dataset can provide information on the most common complaints and service
requests made to the 311 call center. This information can be used to prioritize resources and improve
city services.

Query1:
Top 10 complaint types
SELECT UPPER(`Complaint Type`),COUNT(*) AS ComplaintCount
FROM nycData_abdulhaseeb
GROUP BY UPPER(`Complaint Type`)
ORDER BY ComplaintCount DESC

Query2:
Top 10 complaint types for the year 2022
SELECT UPPER(`Complaint Type`),COUNT(*) AS ComplaintCount
FROM nycData_abdulhaseeb
WHERE substr(`Created Date`, 1, 4) = '2022'
GROUP BY UPPER(`Complaint Type`)
ORDER BY ComplaintCount DESC
LIMIT 10;
